Sorting Algorithms in JAVA for memories and practice 

1.Quick Sort  --- Logically it is the quickest and wildly used algorithm, could use as an enhacement in al lot of JAVA progamming practice: HashMap iterator(which is using BinarySearch)... 

2.Barrel Sort

3.Bubble Sort

4.Insertion Sort

5.Shell Sort --- Thanks for Donald Shell, this algorithm is kind of enhancement of BubbleSorting/InsertionSorting as sorting as group.
